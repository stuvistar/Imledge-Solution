## Problem
Given two text files with alphabetically sorted words, the task is to find the longest and second longest compounded word with time taken to process output too

## Method
Firstly used unordered map to hash strings so that it could be found in O(1) time. Then sorted it and traversed from behind for finding in less amount of time.
Used recursion to find whether part of this word is present or not
Also used Dynamic Programming to reduce time comlexity.
